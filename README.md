# minecraft-serversniffer-discord-bot
this bot is for displaying already scanned servers, its not for scanning. if you dont want to/know how to scan for servers, there is a txt file with 14kish servers ip, version, player count when they got scanned, motd.

player count when they got scanned is irrelevant because bot gets the current status of server(s) before sending it to the user.

the code is shit, scanning thru servers is slow asf and code sometimes simply doesnt want to work. but maybe it has some stuff to be helpful to other people (probably not).
